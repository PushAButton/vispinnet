# VisPinNet
Visual Pinball File Manipulation Library for .NET

NOTE: This library is not fully working at this time.

It is able to read data about a Visual Pinball table, but is not able to alter any data or save tables, as there is an issue generating a matching MD5 hash - although Visual Pinball can *read* the files this library creates, they report as corrupt as the hash doesn't match.
