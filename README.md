# VisPinNet
Visual Pinball File Manipulation Library for .NET

This is a simple library to interact with (ie. read and write) Visual Pinball table files.

The API is still incomplete as there are a number of new extensions to be added. However, with the existing features you should be able to...

   1) Open a Visual Pinball file.
   2) Read table metadata, such as name, author, ROM etc.
   3) Read the table script file
   4) Save changes (ie. script changes, table name etc.) to a Visual Pinball file.

 The focus of the API will be to modify the table script to adjust options such as enabling and disabling important table options.
